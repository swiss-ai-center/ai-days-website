AI is no longer merely computer science but computational science. It can no longer be sustained with self-managed, casual equipment. More advanced compute infrastructures are required to satisfy user needs in terms of power, GPU RAM capacity, software environments, and security, as well as to ensure efficient use of increasingly costly resources. The purpose of this workshop is to gather people responsible for compute infrastructure (on-prem, cloud, or hybrid) aimed at supporting AI workloads (both training and inference) with the goal of creating a community in Switzerland.",
