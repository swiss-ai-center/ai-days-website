This workshop provides a comprehensive but concise overview of Edge AI, focusing on the devices, methods, and tools that make this technology a game-changer. Participants will explore how Edge AI enables real-time data processing, reduces latency, and enhances privacy by minimizing the need to send data to the cloud. By the end of this workshop, participants will have a broad understanding of the fundamental aspects of Edge AI, empowering them to explore and implement these technologies in their own projects.",
